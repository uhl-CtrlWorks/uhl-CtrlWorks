## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Cybernetics Engineer from the University of Stuttgart with a passion for control systems, AI-based approaches, legged locomotion, and automotive dynamics.  
Currently working on drivetrain control, model predictive control (MPC), and model-based testing (PIL/SIL) on embedded hardware.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of physical modeling, data-driven control, and objective system dynamics evaluation.
